# Movie Correlation Analysis


## Project Overview

This Python project explores the relationship between various movie attributes, focusing on budget and gross revenue. Utilizing data analysis and visualization libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), we uncover insights into the correlations between movie characteristics.

## Tasks Accomplished

### 1. Data Preprocessing:
    - Identified and handled missing data
    - Converted budget and gross columns to int64
    - Removed duplicate entries
### 2. Data Visualization:
    - Scatter plot: Budget vs Gross
    - Seaborn plot: Budget vs Gross
    - Created correlation matrix heatmap
### 3. Correlation Analysis:
    - Calculated correlation coefficients
    - Used different methods (Pearson, Kendall, Spearman)
    - Identified highly correlated attributes (> 0.5)

## Libraries Used

- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- NumPy for numerical computations

## Insights Gained

- Understanding of the relationship between movie budget and gross revenue
